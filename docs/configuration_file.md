Configuration file
===================
The configuration file must be named *network_config.yaml* and must be placed in the same directory as the Python source code.

Several sections must be configured:
- global: common to the simulation
- nodes: parameters describing the nodes (end nodes and switches) in the network
- links: links connecting nodes
- requests: demands that will be executing concurrently
